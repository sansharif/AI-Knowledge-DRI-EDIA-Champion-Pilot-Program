   * It's been a slow start for me but I'm lookng forward to our first mentor meeting (we scheudled it for tomorrow and I'll take some time today to talk over our vision statement with them and if we should be switching to GitHub over Codeburg) Happy to be here and share this space with the cohort and organisers

   * Curious but a bit overwhelmed. +1+1
   * Excited! (even though I couldn't add the appropiate gif )

Host: Paz (‚è∞ 10 min) 20

üë• Break-out room (10 minutes, ~3 ppl per room) - Choose one of the following: 

   * Think of a time you were collaborating or working on an open project and it was a complete trainwreck. What happened? What made it chaotic?
   * Think of a time you were collaborating or working on an open project and everything was perfect. What happened? What made it sublime?
‚úèÔ∏è Insights/thoughts/comments to share from your breakout room? 



Written breakout 1

Members: Sara, Saule, Bisola

   * With Bisola we conclude that if people are willing to learn and unlearn, projects flow better.


Written breakout 2

Members:   Ire, Gigi, Jesi, Angelo

   * Guidelines not well defined made collaboration chaotic. Whe did not know exactly what we could or could not do. 
   * Lack of communication. 
   * Trying to do too many things at the same time, less is more. 
   * No clearly deffined roles. No leadership. 
   * Whan is part time and contributions are from a lot of people, messy and overwhelming (github). A lot of code that you don't know what it does. It would  nice to establish how contributions should be made in an orderly manner. 


Written breakout 3

Members: Nicky, LN6

   * Train-wrecks / difficult projects:
       * N: one where we had a manager who wanted all comms to go through them. So lots of point to point communication which led to misconceptions about what we were doing
       * N: Also some people just worked flat out (heroism) and were quite territorial about their areas of work
       * N: Maybe a general problem - some people try to "run before they can walk" - there needs to be a lot of setup, skills development (interpersonal skills) before it can all click
       * LN: Team members would just not agree to do what they were assigned and that made the project a complete nightmare. No fault to the openness of the project but rather the characters of team members
       * Nicky: "Its great when people feel safe to say "I don't know"
   * Projects that "seemed" perfect:
       * N: Define places for where we do comms, save documents etc. Clear responsibilities


Another comment on the chat 

   * +1 "define goals clearly, but let everyone decide on the path to get there"




## üó£Ô∏è Project Structure 

Meli (‚è∞ 2 min) 20

Here are four standard files in open projects: 

   1. LICENSE
   1. README.md
   1. CONTRIBUTING.md
   1. CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md
*We will go over each of these files and best practices for putting them together. Your project may not have this exact structure but should include this information.*



## üñ• README \& Contributing

Host: Paz



Presenter: Eric Gathirwa (‚è∞ 15min) 35

   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2-6PbJiPOYGBGsHJbKj9Y49iPHsHnAIKnhCuV40U3I/edit#slide=id.g2224fafcba8\_0\_37](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2-6PbJiPOYGBGsHJbKj9Y49iPHsHnAIKnhCuV40U3I/edit#slide=id.g2224fafcba8\_0\_37)
   * 



Notes:

   * *Read more about []writing a README[]: *[https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/](*[]https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/[]*)
   * To extend the book metaphor, maybe a README is more like a Foreword? Yes


Questions / Comments (silent GDoc-ing and +1ing)

   * How important is to write a README? VERY Important! Think of it as a proposal without an exceutive summary or a publication without an abstract. It will be difficult to find your way around.
   * Are READMEs always written in markdown? Yes, for GitHub.
   * A landing page? Yes
   * Has GitLab a similar set of features (twitter debacle made me more aware of relying on a single thing)Almost the same but the interface is different. I prefer GitHub though ;)
   * Does anybody have any recommendations for beginner Git or Github courses? Kindly take a look at the slides shared, they have some useful links. Thank you!!!

Questions / Comments / your own tips for picking a license?

   * Some interesting controversy around GitHub copilot [https://fossa.com/blog/analyzing-legal-implications-github-copilot/](https://fossa.com/blog/analyzing-legal-implications-github-copilot/), I'm wondering how lisences extend to other (non-code) contirbutions (eg issues, comments, etc) made to github repositories. And what is the default for non-code contributions?

Access to Zenodo‚Äôs content is open to all, for non-military purposes only." - [https://about.zenodo.org/terms/](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/)
