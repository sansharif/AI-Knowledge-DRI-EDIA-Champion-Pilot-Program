#### Before the call: Please do this at least 3 business days in advance.

_Time commitment: 10-20 minutes_

- [ ] Message the Coordinator to confirm (or decline) your participation in the Call as a Facilitator, and ask who the Call Host will be. When you get a response, message the Call Host and ask for the call notes (Etherpad).  
- [ ] Review the cohort call notes (or Etherpad). In many cases, we copy the notes document from the last cohort, so it is always good to check or correct issues like:
- All links for the current cohort (like the Zoom call), ask the cohort coordinator if something is not clear.
- Any typos or formatting errors like headers, dates, timing, hosts’ names, speakers’ names etc.

#### During the call: Please join 10 minutes before time

_Time commitment: 90 minutes per call, please arrive 10 minutes early so we can assign you as a co-host and coordinate with the host who will chair each presentation or breakout discussion during the call._

- [ ] Ask the call lead for co-host rights and check if the call will be recorded on the cloud (if applicable, because some calls are not recorded, or parts of them are not recorded, like in week 13 for the skills-up call on self-care).
- [ ] Test if you can create breakout rooms.
- [ ] Help manage participants by letting them in (if the waiting room is enabled) and mute them if their mic is on when they are not speaking to avoid background noise.
- [ ] Keep an eye on the chat and respond to questions. You can also privately coordinate with the participants or cohort call lead as needed, for example, if someone needs help with addressing any confusion or interruptions for attendees.
- [ ] Remind newcomers via the chat to add an_ S _or a _W_ in front of their Zoom name (S for spoken; W for written), for the breakout rooms. Privately coordinate with them if they have not indicated ‘W’ for written and ‘S’ for speaking to allow the creation of breakout rooms.
- [ ] Share the Etherpad link in the chat for the participants who arrive late and remind them to add their names in the roll call section of the Etherpad.
- [ ] Please also help take some notes on the Etherpad per talk when you are not chairing.
- [ ] During the call, share the Etherpad’s line number where the participants should respond to a written reflection, questions or comments for speakers, prompts for the breakout discussion or notes section from breakout sessions.
- [ ] Create the breakout rooms if needed, considering people’s choice for spoken or written rooms.
- [ ] Chair the parts that you have agreed to (you would have coordinated this in advance with the call leads or coordinator)

#### After the call, fill in the following information in our [OLS-9 planning sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tnk-kkHUmPOEfUOEAl627l6JS9SoY5D4gSAPCYoBRSY/edit#gid=2109933309) (the tab is “OLS-9”)

- [ ] Add the name of the confirmed speakers (column L)
- [ ] Add the title of the talk (column F)
- [ ] Add link to slides (column M)
- [ ] (Not in the planning sheet) Export the notes (the etherpad) to our OLS-8 Github repo, in the corresponding week [https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-8](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-8). This means you have to add a file to the GH repo. Name the file `week-XX-notes.md`. How to export from Etherpad? Go to the two arrows on the top right of the pad, and choose markdown as file to export. **Please make sure to remove the names of call participants (not hosts, facilitators or speakers). Do not delete participants' comments or questions.**

After you’ve completed these tasks please fill out the honorarium form:
