## 🖥 Community Interactions!

Yo (15 min)[⏰ 30]



**Presenter**: Omotola Omotayo

   * Contact / social: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/omotola-omotayo-9406b8162/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omotola-omotayo-9406b8162/) , [https://twitter.com/elegant\_tolly](https://twitter.com/elegant\_tolly)

**Notes**:

   *  Omotola Omotayo (she/her) - Community builder, DEI advocate,  Outreachy Organizer, Founder Elegance Media
   * Who is community? People *are* community. Community *is* people. They come together for shared interests, but from different perspectives (age groups, geographic regions, level of experience). 
   * Community interaction from perspective of ***community builder***
       * Key to ask: why am I bringing people together? Clear understanding of community objectives. Are community members benefiting from their participation?
       * Develop strategies to build with your members. Ex. if you ask for volunteers and more people show up than you can accomodate, acknowledge them, offer to put them in a waiting list / future opportunities
       * Intentionally inclusive / exclusive - think about who are the members of the community. 
       * Interactions can include / should consider: events, initiatives, designs, contents and language, communication (open, empathy, acknowledge and appreciate), track community health and interactions, take feedback.
   * Community interaction from perspective of ***community member***
       * From this side, also be mindful of what the community stands for and why you joined.
   * CHAOSS - Community Inclusion survey
   * Book recommendation: The Art of Gathering


**Questions**

   *  How hard is to sustain a media space? Main obstacle (funding?) 
It might be hard based on the individual or organization. I will recommend getting professional and experienced volunteers to do it. Have clear key results in mind and review your strategies frequently.

   * Is media presence a "must" if you want to influence higher levels of decision-making? or, in your case, is that mostly aimed at general or wider populations/groups? 
       * From an individual perspective vs. an institutional perspective, have a good online presence to reach your target audience! "With the world we are in now, in my terms, I will say having a good and conscience online presence is a must."
   *  Examples of strategies to mitigate community inclusion/exclusion?
       * Start by understanding your community. At every stage of designing your community, make intentional decisions.
   * Yo / I love your examples of thinking carefully about timezones and hosting multiple events if needed. 


## 🖥 Mountain of Engagement!

[Paz] (15 min)[⏰ 45]

**Presenter**: Stefanie Butland

   * Contact / social: stefanie@openscapes.org
   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h0XAN45QdYZox2aWPi3VoYR-rpBKp09OA4-LQrFu00o/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h0XAN45QdYZox2aWPi3VoYR-rpBKp09OA4-LQrFu00o/edit)
**Notes**:

   *  Stefanie -Scientist \& community manager. AAAS/CSCCE Fellowship, Openscapes - 
   * What is a Mountain of Engagement? A pathway to community leadership. 
       * Newcomers
       * Path to level up: from discovery to sustained engagement and leadership
   * Stages:
       * 1. Discovery: how people first hear about the project. Ex: Openscapes - we work in the open (documentation and project management)
       * 2. First contact: how people first engage with the project (engagement not enough! Look for the "cracks" - Why whould I sign up for this? Meet people where they are)
       * 3. Participation. Motivations -> actions -> how-to. Ex. rOpenSci Community Guide that links "I want to" -> resources.
       * 4. Sustained participation - How their involvement can continue. rOpenSci and Openscapes - User -> Reviewer -> submitter -> Editor. It's a pathway of more time committment and responsibility, hopefully also more rewarding. Sustained by combination of volunteer + remmunerated work
       * 5. Networked participation. Openscapes - formalized mentorship programs. Support for their own communities.
   *  A path that invests in new maintainers is backbone [...]


**Questions**

   *  How do you improve your visibility in the social space when you're new in the space? 
       * Go back to: Community is people. If people know you personally, speak from that personal perspective. Build trust with them and appeal to people from that place. Ex. "I am so excited about this event
       * There is a technical side: post on multiple social media networks. 
   * Follow up: But how do you build trust? Stay true to yourself! Talk about your missions. Show results. Partner with similar organizations.  We can’t answer to everyone’s complaints; we’ll get burned out. Be yourself
   * A bit related to the question above: I am curious about the first stages of the participation phase, do you have any anecdotes of how this happens, do users start creating issues on github? or do they contact you directly?
       * a good, hard question. Was hard at rOpenSci because there were so many places ppl could participate. Some folks really comfortable with github and some not. One thing that helped was writing (e.g. README, or Contributing Guide) to outline the preferred starting points. A common way ppl discovered \& started participating was by attending a community call - low barrier but they get exposed to how to participate more. Rare that ppl started by opening issues on GitHub but if they used an R package, they might open an issue about the pkg. 
       * At Openscapes initial contact is often through another organization or research lab that wants us to lead an Openscapes Champions program for them. We work with them to "advertise" internally about benefits of participating
       * super valuable, thanks!
 

## 👥 Value exchanges!

[Yo] introduces, [Gigi] makes breakouts (15 min) [⏰ 60]

15 minutes, ~3 ppl per room



### Instructions for the room

Reflect on: What are you giving to your community, organization, or project? What is it giving back? If there are gaps, how might you close them?

Prompts for discussion:

   * What kinds of things do you give to others in your open leadership practices?
   * What kinds of things do you get back?
   * Does the balance seem right to you, or are there adjustments you’d like to make?


### Notes from breakout discussions

Breakout Room 1 - Spoken

   * Names
           * Gloria
           * Marlou
           * Stefanie
   * Notes
           * Marlou: make survey data on corporate social responsibility publicly available. The original idea for the project was very focused on sending but because the OLS calls, also thinking about how to connect with the community and how to engage users. Maybe celebrate and acknowledge people who publish with or on the data
           * Gloria: organize trainings and workshops in agriculture for youth about sustainable agriculture practices (to adapt to climate change). After the training, create an app so the training is sustained and can be shared by ex-participants (??). It can also help to combat unemployment. Get feedback from researchers. What does the community back from participants. You can learn from people who succeeded (as examples and through the app).
               * what we get back: see how ppl set up their farms; and able to use that to help others
               * Main objective: for people to learn, and inspiring other community members
Breakout Room 2 - Written

   * Names
           * Elena Beretta
           * Julián
   * Notes
               * Julián: I'm getting quite involved in the dialogue of the community. Searching, learning about and sharing resources, projects and opportunities that may be interesting to the rest of the community. I get back good feedback and I am also learning a lot about topics that are new to me. I think the balance is right. For my part, I could continue to provide scaffolding, guidelines, proposals and invitations so that the rest of the community fells increasingly comfortable and confident to share and making their contributions.
           * Elena: I'm working on how to get the affected community from research subject to stakeholder.


Breakout Room 3 - spoken and written

- Arianna, Ruben, Max

We first discussed how existing communities actually started off, so the participation phase. What came first, users or investors that saw the potential. How do you reach a target audience, e.g. we all work on projects where we try to build some form of data platform; how do you gain the trust of people; do you need to build a network, e.g. at conferences; are physical meetings important? How do you motivate people to join the community, incentives?



Breakout Room 4 - Spoken

   * Names
           * Omotola
           * Virginia
           * Stephane (Mboalab)
   * Notes
           * For Elegance Media (Omotola's startup), I'm giving my team the ability to lead their team and take ownership of the role. It's an open, positive, give-and-take relationship. They are gaining expertise, getting to know new people, and building professional relationships. 
           * Empowering team members and craving a career niche for them
           * Thinking and trying to create the best structure for the community
           * Stephan( Mobolab): providing empowerment opportunities for people while, in turn, giving the community more information about the project's needs, creating more awareness regarding their products, and getting feedback and ideas on new products. The members also gain from the community which is a win-win for both. 
           * It seems that the balance is good, although room for improvment

## 🖥 Personas \& Pathways!

[Gigi] (15 min)[⏰ 75]



**Presenter**: Stephane Fadanka

   * Contact / social:
   * Slides: SLIDES


**Notes**:

   *  Stephane Fadanka - Executive Director Mboalab. Community based innovation hub. Working with communities 
   * Personas \& Pathways - Desgin elements where understanding your audience is critical. Clear, human-centered view of people you're trying to reach and serve.
   * Personas
       * What? Model and description of a person. Personified user-target profile. Detailed descriptions, build out of well-understood, data about real people. Place the focus on specific users rather than "everyone". - In limiting our choices, personas help us make better choices. 
       * Why? Become more people focused (vs product focused). Interest and empathy towards users. Focus on and design for a small set of specific users. 
       * When? Early in the project. Because understanding target audience helps shape project direction.
   * How? Create and visualize user personas and their journeys when interacting with a product / service
       * Flowcharts and diagrams
       * Persona infrographics, persona cards
       * Collaborative whiteboard. Ex. Miro
   * An example: Working with the community for a Peace building makerspace
       * Data collection tools (surveys, interviews)
       * Context and environment
       * Maintain the communication
       * Theory of change (problem, impact, outcomes, outputs, activities)
   * Check out the references from the presentation


**Questions**

   *  Using personas, how do you avoid the pitfall of focusing too  much on experienced users and thus creating (unintentionally) barriers for inexperienced users? Or for people from demographic groups that are small(er) in the community (e.g. people from the Global South, older people, women etc.) +1
       * Create subgroups from your community. Address specific needs, make sure you get the right info from those specific groups at the design stage. 
   *  


## 👥 Silent reflections!

[HOST] (10 min)[⏰ 85]

### Questions

What was insightful about thinking about persona and pathways for inclusion? 

   *  I think we focus a lot on how to include as many people as possible and differentiation always seems a red flag for inclusion. However, the personas and pathways emphasizes how it can actually  help to include people
   *  


What pathways have you already created? What other personas and pathways you didn't consider for your project?

   *  I think my project is in vision tailored to both academics and non-academics, yet in practice I think the academic side is much more important. So I think it's important to think about both user pathways
   *  




What are you doing now to provide mentored support to contributors?

   *  
   *  




What other ways you can create to center voices of marginalised groups?

   *  
   *
