### Notes from breakout discussions

Breakout Room 5 - Written

   * Rebeca: 
       * What was your path to this program?: I am the coordinator of the CABANAnet (teaching bioinformatics) project in Latin America. So we got invited to the CATALYST project to expand the impact of this project knowing that there are regions in the continent lacking computing facilities. 
       * How did you get into working open?: I work in a public university and we must share almost everything, however we are not well trained in open science. So, I try to do my best based on what I learned from other collaborators.
       * How has working open affected your leadership?: we get in contact with more people everytime. Which is good but also complicated because of time constraints.
 

   * Ruke : I am the product manager for Molerhealth. We are participating to enable create impact through the development of our EMR MVP (Electronic Medical Records Minimum Viable Product ). We hope to unify medical record electronically and at an affordable rate for both patients and medics in Nigeria and beyond. I got involved in Open through MolerHealth work. For the 3rd question, we are learning to navigate our team collaboration processes better
   * Nihad: I do work for Kush Centre and as a part of it we're trying to build an open science community in Sudan as we're lagged a bit in this matter
       * 2. Working in H3ABiNet and ELwazi projects were the first step for to get involved in the open science community as one of their projects are concerned with OS plus in 2018 Mozilla OS Tour were held at our centre in Sudan so this is how it all started form my side
       * 3. It's going well collaboration wise for us at the centre
