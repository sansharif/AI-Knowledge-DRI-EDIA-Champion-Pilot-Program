   * Give examples of 3 use cases of the different Open Science principles

### Icebreaker question

What website or app doesn‚Äôt exist, but you really wish it did?

   *  A name prompt app. To help me practice, remember and correctly spell people‚Äôs names +100!
   *  Yo / hmmm. it probably does exist, but I want to be able to write in names, cities, and then always be able to look at the app and say - Oh, it's 10:00 for Arielle! 
       * oh I love the open window to a city website -- it is not the same but would be cool to have the personalised for teams/groups.
   *  Malvika / dress code app - a new idea everyday (I have been very much a comfy clothes each day person).
       * Mandatory oodies pls
   *  Hana/ hm maybe some automatic map suggestions in a new city based on your interests? +1
   *  +1 Tania: meal ideas based on what is available on the fridge +1 + 1 (Google Cooking! I do it often. Just enter ingredients into google and the keyword "recipe" üò±
   * Automatic merging of datasets based on AI
   *  Lena: my ideal app to take notes combined with photos which works on all my devices
   *  Melissa: an app that lets you take a photo of any animal, plant, mushroom etc and identifies it. I've used one for birds but the database wasn't very large

## üñ• Talk: Open Source Software

Arielle (15 min) [‚è∞ 25]

   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mainogyd9OzOGA3BfKVQXIPbzCB08oaeyCUhz8gxTjc/edit#slide=id.g2a2d191dc2e\_5\_303](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mainogyd9OzOGA3BfKVQXIPbzCB08oaeyCUhz8gxTjc/edit#slide=id.g2a2d191dc2e\_5\_303) 

**Notes**:
   *  Success of open source software is largely dependent on community! 
   *  Malvika: For those who are not developers, can use these principles to make choices for software or packages they use in their research. There are many packages/tools, but often we end up using a few that our colleagues tell us about. To assess if those are good quality ‚Äî will provide reproducible/verifiable results, we can look at aspects like documentation, people willing to respond to errors/issues etc.
   * Bus factor indicaiton of project health - the more people need to be hit by a bus in order for the proeproject to fully stop, the healthier the project is
       * Also known as "Bermuda factor" (as in, when people win the lottery and move to Bermuda üòâ)

**Questions**

   * Q OSS or FOSS? 
       * (A from Yo) made a helpful distinction between F/L (Free / Libre) software is "you can't tell me what to do While OSS is more "pragmatic capitalism" (thanks Yo)
   * How to balance maintenance of packages with the driving incentives present across a lot of academia towards novelty?  
       * Longer funding schedules can help people collaborate and build trust, contributes to better research, better community 
   *  I like the "Bus Factor metric" Here in the global south the bus factor is really high. 
   *  I wonder if indeed there will be enough people "on it", contributing to your software; my feeling is that the creator is very much accountable even in the early stages of the project
   * Could you give the reference to the "tyranny to un -structuredness" article?  
       * [https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)
   * Invisible form of work is really important to keeping the whole thing together. Is this like duct tape? 

## üñ• Talk: Open Science Infrastructures

**Notes**:
   *  Invest in open infrastructure (ioi) [https://investinopen.org/](https://investinopen.org/)
   *  OSI: systems and tools that rely on both physical and digital infrastructure intended to provide open services for the scientific community
   *  Three components:
       * Infrastructure (physical and digital) - we rely on physical components that are available
       * Social (networks of collaboration, volunteer driven efforts) - invisible work behind theopen science initiative, there is also a lot of volunteer work involved
       * Innovation (test and prototype, non-profit alternatives) - many of the initiatives remain non for profit providing free services to the research community. These services are more accessible than their commercial counterparts
   * Good design checklist
       * Physical requirements
       * Integrate Digital + physical design
       * *Include stakeholders in decision-making process*
       * Recognize volunteer work
       * Provide low cost solutions
   * POST  - principles of open scholarly infrastructure (POSI) [https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)


Is the cloud infrastructure a problem for localisation? - yes, it might be if you have bad internet connection and if your computer can't run this service. It's important to look beyond the global north

**Questions**
   * Q: So methinks that OSI is really important. But when OSI is placed in the cloud, it means that local capacity is not developed. Yes, money is saved. But the benefits of localization is lost. Be interested in your thoughts? W 
   * Q: Who drives the innovation component? I would think that it should be universities? But my experience is that this is is spun out very quickly to commercial concerns (I assume to keep the project to sustainable)  
   * Q: are there good examples of important innovations in research/science taking off from free infrastructures provided by non-for-profits? 
       * IOI is working on mapping open infrastructure service providers (tool will be live next year), here is the link to previous work on that area: [https://investinopen.org/catalog/](https://investinopen.org/catalog/)
  
## üë• Breakout discussion: Open Science and You

Irene introduces, Malvika makes breakouts (15 min) [‚è∞ 55]
15 minutes, ~3/4 ppl per room



### Instructions for the room
Discussion prompts for the room:
   * Do you practise or advocate for open source software, infrastructure and practices?
       * If you do, explain how.
       * If you don‚Äôt, explain what you think the difference is between practising open science and advocating for it.


### Notes from breakout discussions

Breakout Room 1 - Written
   * Notes
           * I believe I operate in field where most software is not open source, but we are advocating for it quite vocally
           * I/we do, but I sometimes feel that it is not always for the right reasons. Or at least there are two sides to it, we advocate let's say that researchers make their data/software/research open (source), impose rules and/or guidelines on how to do it "right", but each case is different. So it's a good thing that we emphasize the importance of data stewards or RSEs who come with the expertise to differentiate
           * Like X says, the two sides are that we openly advocate for open science/source but we often don't adhere to it ourselves. Sure, it can be hard to find a replacement for complex software / cloud services, but there are also cases where we really should use an open alternative, take MS Office for instance


Breakout Room 2 - Spoken

   * Notes
       * Y practices open science and software at work - libraries of tools, open source software construction 
       * Differences between advocating vs practising? 
       * Self-reflection kind of question 
       * Could always be doing more, no one is "perfect" in their open practices - requires a lot of privilege and the right institution
       * Don't always have the right resources for using open software /cloud infrastructure etc 
       * Discussion on translation efforts away from English


Breakout Room 3 - Spoken

## üñ• Talk: Open Hardware

Arielle (15 min) [‚è∞ 70]

**Presenter**: Pierre Padilla

   * Contact / social: pgpadilla@uc.cl / @biodotpe (Twitter and Instagram)
   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aluBnA6hziHb0gHulR6PkkJTPsZMaXDN/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=118073970427420961369\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aluBnA6hziHb0gHulR6PkkJTPsZMaXDN/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=118073970427420961369\&rtpof=true\&sd=true)

**Notes**: 
   *  Challenge: importing equipment to Peru from Global North
   *  Open Hardware to democratize technology, lower cost, custom-ability, easier maintenance  and collaboration, modification 
   * Dev cycle:
       * Identify problem or need
       * Create prototype of product or scientific instrument
       * Products also includes: instructions, version control, contribution guides, schematics
   * Examples:
       * OpenFlexure - microscope
   * GOSH

**Questions**

   * Open Science Hardware is a Black Box. I suspect that the reason why the black box remain opaque, is because budget is spent on marketing, and not documentation? There is an incentive to keep the box opaque, because it keeps you in a job? Is this fair. Or too broad?
