**Questions**

   * Maybe this will come up later, but how do you feel about authors paying exorbitant  prices to have their paper published Open Access in a journal fro a traditional journal?
   * I got the impression (perhaps backed up by the data you showed about preprint publications) that preprints became much more prevalent during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Do you think this change is permanent? Or will we see researchers revert to "the old way" of publishing straight to a journal now that developments have slowed down with Covid?
   * Are there guidelines to contribute to datasets on observable (on site) marine variables? I do not find something similar in the website. Is this the sort of thing you are thinking about, as we promote the GSC checklists for marine metagenomic sampling for example [http://www.gensc.org/pages/projects/micro-b3-project.html](http://www.gensc.org/pages/projects/micro-b3-project.html)

## üë• Breakout discussion: Benefits of becoming an open scientists

[HOST] introduces, [HOST] makes breakouts (15 min) [‚è∞ 55]

15 minutes, ~3/4 ppl per room



### Instructions for the room

Discussion prompts for the room:

   * What are the benefits of becoming an open scientists?
   * What incentives to participate in science (just science) have you encountered throughout your life?


### Notes from breakout discussions

Main Room

   * Names
           * Everyone!
   * Notes
           * Marlou: I think what Toby just mentioned is a very important benefit of open science: more people read or use your work. It increases impact!
           * Robert: When I do Open Science I present what I believe "this is how I did it, to the best of my knowledge, this is also how it should have been done". But I keep it open for others to disagree and tell me about the errors I conducted in the experiments / analysis.  It becomes more of a discussion. (Closed science is "believe it or not".)
           * Scott: Fairer, more equitable
           * Toby: Through open science, I've become part of a community again. The community is very inspiring and supportive. It's a nice community to be involved it.

   *   Yo / I love the growth metaphor <3 we use it in OLS too, although I think the people are the seeds we water and nuture, usually. 
   *  Yo / Recently a couple of Kenyan friends shared their experience of the 2008 electoral violence with me - it was such a life changing event. I didn't realise that was the roots of Ushahidi! 
   *  Has the government reach out to your organization?
